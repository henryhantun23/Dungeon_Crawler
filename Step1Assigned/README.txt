I have given you an example xml parser in the folder exampleParserSource, and an xml file that it parses. My hope is that this will help you with step 1.  I have included a fair number of comments in this file.

javaStep1.pdf gives the requirements for the step.

step1Output.txt gives some sample output for the first step running on the dungeon.xml. Use this as an idea of the basic idea of the output -- you should not spend time trying to make yours look like this.
